			I am a junior Computer Science student on the Software Engineering track at Baylor University.
			As a computer scientist, I have found that I enjoy UI/UX, data analytics and product/project management.
			I am currently seeking internship opportunites within those sectors of industry for Summer 2019.
			Currently, my future academic plans are to enter a Ph.D. program in Computer Science to pursue work in academia.
			My interests outside of Computer Science are: music (classical), clarinet, naps and food! If I am not infront of a computer you can find me enjoying one of those.
